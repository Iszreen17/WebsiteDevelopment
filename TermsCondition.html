            <p>Hello Cookie Monsters!</p>
            <p>By signing up for the Cookisz membership, you’ll enjoy exclusive perks like early access to new goodies,
                special birthday discounts, and points for every order you make — all sent straight to your inbox or
                phone! Just make sure your info is accurate so we can celebrate you properly and keep you updated. We
                may adjust the membership perks or terms from time to time. Any misuse (like fake details or trying to
                game the system) may lead to cancellation of your membership. Don’t worry — we respect your privacy and
                promise not to share your personal details without your OK.
            </p>
            <p> Refund Policy:
                Because our treats are freshly baked and made to order, we’re unable to offer refunds once your order is
                confirmed. However, if there’s an issue with your order — like the wrong item or damage during delivery
                — do reach out to us within 24 hours and we’ll do our best to make it right.
            </p>
            <p> Not feeling the membership anymore? No problem. You can unsubscribe anytime by clicking the unsubscribe
                link in our emails or contacting us directly. Just keep in mind that once you unsubscribe, you’ll no
                longer receive member-only deals, updates, or points.
            </p>
